# üìä Electoral Bond Data Analysis Project

## üöÄ Project Overview
In this project, we analyze the Electoral Bond data following the Supreme Court's landmark judgment mandating transparency in political party funding. The Election Commission of India (ECI) released comprehensive data, which is supplemented by additional data from the Enforcement Directorate. This analysis focuses on understanding the flow of money from donors to recipients, identifying sources of monetary donations, and assessing the impact of political funding transparency.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Tables
We have three main data tables:
1. **Donor Data**: Details about companies, organizations, and individuals who bought electoral bonds.
2. **Receiver Data**: Details about political parties and the bonds they received.
3. **Bank Data**: Details about bank branches where bonds can be issued or encashed.
